This Repo contains the source code of the workshop "HackStack" 
The workshop was for building a website that fetches data from TheMovieDatabase using the provided API and displaying that data on our website.
The landing page of our site is index.html from on which all the data is loaded.
For each movie we basically fetch 4 components (the poster, name, rating and overview).
