<h2>This Repo contains the source code of the workshop "HackStack" </h2>
<ul>
<li>The workshop was for building a website that fetches data from TheMovieDatabase using the provided API and displaying that data on our website.</li>
<li>The landing page of our site is index.html from on which all the data is loaded.</li>
<li>For each movie we basically fetch 4 components (the poster, name, rating and overview).</li>
  <li>The site is live at  https://deepak-006.github.io/project.github.io/
  </li>
</ul>
